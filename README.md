"AcroBot" is a project I came up with at Uplight. After merging 6 companies together in 2019, Uplight's slack was full of over 400 acronyms for people to need at any given time.

The first iteration of Acrobot, found [here](https://github.com/jfefes/acrobot) served as an MVP and proof of concept that a bot would be helpful to remember these acronyms. "Acrobot1" utilized the Slack Real Time Messaging API (RTM), and found acronyms stored locally in a json file.

This project, dubbed Acrobot2, is designed to work off of Slack's Events API and Slash commands. This repo contains abstracted work done to make Acrobot2 run on AWS Lambda for Uplight.
